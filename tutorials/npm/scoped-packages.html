        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>All npm packages have a name. Some package names also have a scope. A scope follows the usual rules for package names (URL-safe characters, no leading dots or underscores). When used in package names, scopes are preceded by an @ symbol and followed by a slash, e.g.</p>
        <code>@somescope/somepackagename</code>
        <p>Scopes are a way of grouping related packages together, and also affect a few things about the way npm treats the package.</p>
        <p>Each npm user/organization has their own scope, and only you can add packages in your scope. This means you don't have to worry about someone taking your package name ahead of you. Thus it is also a good way to signal official packages for organizations.</p>
        <p>Scoped packages can be published and installed as of npm@2 and are supported by the primary npm registry. Unscoped packages can depend on scoped packages and vice versa. The npm client is backwards-compatible with unscoped registries, so it can be used to work with scoped and unscoped registries at the same time.</p>

        <h2>Installing scoped packages</h2>
        <p>Scoped packages are installed to a sub-folder of the regular installation folder, e.g. if your other packages are installed in node_modules/packagename, scoped modules will be installed in node_modules/@myorg/packagename. The scope folder (@myorg) is simply the name of the scope preceded by an @ symbol, and can contain any number of scoped packages.</p>
        <p>A scoped package is installed by referencing it by name, preceded by an @ symbol, in npm install:</p>
        <code>npm install @myorg/mypackage</code>
        <p>Or in package.json:</p>
        <pre><code>
            "dependencies": {
                "@myorg/mypackage": "^1.3.0"
              }
        </code></pre>
        <p>Note that if the @ symbol is omitted, in either case, npm will instead attempt to install from GitHub; see npm install.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="div3">
        <h2>Requiring scoped packages</h2>
        <p>Because scoped packages are installed into a scope folder, you have to include the name of the scope when requiring them in your code, e.g.</p>
        <code>require('@myorg/mypackage')</code>
        <p>There is nothing special about the way Node treats scope folders. This simply requires the mypackage module in the folder named @myorg.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="div4">
        <h2>Associating a scope with a registry</h2>
        <p>Scopes can be associated with a separate registry. This allows you to seamlessly use a mix of packages from the primary npm registry and one or more private registries, such as GitHub Packages or the open source Verdaccio project.</p>
        <p>You can associate a scope with a registry at login, e.g.</p>
        <code>npm login --registry=http://reg.example.com --scope=@myco</code>
        <p>Scopes have a many-to-one relationship with registries: one registry can host multiple scopes, but a scope only ever points to one registry.</p>
        <p>You can also associate a scope with a registry using npm config:</p>
        <code>npm config set @myco:registry http://reg.example.com</code>
        <p>Once a scope is associated with a registry, any npm install for a package with that scope will request packages from that registry instead. Any npm publish for a package name that contains the scope will be published to that registry instead.</p>
