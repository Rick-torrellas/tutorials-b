    <h1>Tagging</h1>
    <p>Like most VCSs, Git has the ability to tag specific points in a repository’s history as being important. Typically, people use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, v2.0 and so on). In this section, you’ll learn how to list existing tags, how to create and delete tags, and what the different types of tags are.</p>
    <div>
        <h2>Listing Your Tags</h2>
        <p>Listing the existing tags in Git is straightforward. Just type git tag (with optional -l or --list):</p>
        <pre><code>
$ git tag
v1.0
v2.0
        </code></pre>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Creating Tags</h2>
        <p>Git supports two types of tags: lightweight and annotated.</p>
        <p>A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn’t change — it’s just a pointer to a specific commit.</p>
        <p>Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They’re checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG). It’s generally recommended that you create annotated tags so you can have all this information; but if you want a temporary tag or for some reason don’t want to keep the other information, lightweight tags are available too.</p>
        <p>You can see the tag data along with the commit that was tagged by using the git show command:</p>
        <h3>Annotated Tags</h3>
        <p>Creating an annotated tag in Git is simple. The easiest way is to specify -a when you run the tag command:</p>
        <pre><code>
            $ git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"
            $ git tag
            v0.1
            v1.3
            v1.4
        </code></pre>
        <h3>Lightweight Tags</h3>
        <p>Another way to tag commits is with a lightweight tag. This is basically the commit checksum stored in a file — no other information is kept. To create a lightweight tag, don’t supply any of the -a, -s, or -m options, just provide a tag name:</p>
        <pre><code>
            $ git tag v1.4-lw
            $ git tag
            v0.1
            v1.3
            v1.4
            v1.4-lw
            v1.5
        </code></pre>
        <p>This time, if you run git show on the tag, you don’t see the extra tag information. The command just shows the commit:</p>
        <h3>Tagging Later</h3>
        <p>You can also tag commits after you’ve moved past them. Suppose your commit history looks like this:</p>
        <pre><code>
            $ git log --pretty=oneline
            15027957951b64cf874c3557a0f3547bd83b3ff6 Merge branch 'experiment'
            a6b4c97498bd301d84096da251c98a07c7723e65 Create write support
            0d52aaab4479697da7686c15f77a3d64d9165190 One more thing
            6d52a271eda8725415634dd79daabbc4d9b6008e Merge branch 'experiment'
            0b7434d86859cc7b8c3d5e1dddfed66ff742fcbc Add commit function
            4682c3261057305bdd616e23b64b0857d832627b Add todo file
            166ae0c4d3f420721acbb115cc33848dfcc2121a Create write support
            9fceb02d0ae598e95dc970b74767f19372d61af8 Update rakefile
            964f16d36dfccde844893cac5b347e7b3d44abbc Commit the todo
            8a5cbc430f1a9c3d00faaeffd07798508422908a Update readme
        </code></pre>
        <p>Now, suppose you forgot to tag the project at v1.2, which was at the “Update rakefile” commit. You can add it after the fact. To tag that commit, you specify the commit checksum (or part of it) at the end of the command:</p>
        <code>git tag -a v1.2 9fceb02</code>
        <h3>Sharing Tags</h3>
        <p>By default, the git push command doesn’t transfer tags to remote servers. You will have to explicitly push tags to a shared server after you have created them. This process is just like sharing remote branches — you can run git push origin &lt;tagname>.</p>
        <code>$ git push origin v1.5</code>
        <p>If you have a lot of tags that you want to push up at once, you can also use the --tags option to the git push command. This will transfer all of your tags to the remote server that are not already there.</p>
        <code>git push origin --tags</code>
        <h3>Deleting Tags</h3>
        <p>To delete a tag on your local repository, you can use git tag -d &lt;tagname>. For example, we could remove our lightweight tag above as follows:</p>
            <code>git tag -d v1.4-lw</code>
        <p>Note that this does not remove the tag from any remote servers. There are two common variations for deleting a tag from a remote server.</p>
        <p>The first variation is git push &lt;remote> :refs/tags/&lt;tagname>:</p>
        <code>git push origin :refs/tags/v1.4-lw</code>
        <p>The way to interpret the above is to read it as the null value before the colon is being pushed to the remote tag name, effectively deleting it.</p>
        <p>The second (and more intuitive) way to delete a remote tag is with:</p>
        <code>git push origin --delete &lt;tagname></code>
        <h3>Checking out Tags</h3>
        <p>If you want to view the versions of files a tag is pointing to, you can do a git checkout of that tag, although this puts your repository in “detached HEAD” state, which has some ill side effects:</p>
        <code>git checkout v2.0.0</code>
        <p>In “detached HEAD” state, if you make changes and then create a commit, the tag will stay the same, but your new commit won’t belong to any branch and will be unreachable, except by the exact commit hash. Thus, if you need to make changes — say you’re fixing a bug on an older version, for instance — you will generally want to create a branch:</p>
        <code>git checkout -b version2 v2.0.0</code>
        <p>If you do this and make a commit, your version2 branch will be slightly different than your v2.0.0 tag since it will move forward with your new changes, so do be careful.</p>
