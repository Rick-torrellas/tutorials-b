        <h1>How to Fix Fatal Error: Maximum Execution Time Exceeded in WordPress</h1>
        <p>Are you seeing ‘Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded’ on your screen when trying to update a WordPress plugin or theme?</p>
        <p>Typically this problem occurs when a PHP code in WordPress takes a long time to run and reaches the maximum time limit set by your WordPress hosting server. The time limit is important because it helps prevent the abuse of server resources.</p>
        <div>
            <h2>Why Maximum Execution Time Exceeded Error Occurs?</h2>
            <p>WordPress is coded mainly in the PHP programming language. To protect web servers from abuse, there is a time limit set for how long a PHP script can run.</p>
            <p>The actual time limit varies across hosting companies, however most of the times the maximum execution time is set between 30 – 60 seconds because that’s usually enough for a good PHP script to run.</p>
            <p>When a script reaches the maximum execution time limit, it results in maximum execution time exceeded error.</p>

            <h2>Fixing Maximum Execution Time Exceeded Error</h2>
            <p>Although Maximum Execution Time Exceeded error is named a ‘fatal error,’ it is one of the most common WordPress errors, and you can easily resolve this.</p>
            <p>This is part of the fatal error protection feature added in WordPress 5.2. You may also receive an email that will tell you which plugin (if a plugin triggered the error) caused the issue.</p>
            <p>The email will also include a special link, which will allow you to log in to WordPress with ‘Recovery mode’.</p>
            <p>Once there, you can simply deactivate or delete the plugin causing the error.</p>
            <p>However, if you don’t want to deactivate a plugin, then you can fix the underlying cause that triggered the error.</p>
            <div>
                <h2>.htaccess</h2>
                <p>To fix the error, you will need to manually edit your .htaccess file and add a simple line of code.</p>
                <p>Simply connect to your website using an FTP client.</p>
                <p>Your .htaccess file is located in the same folder as your /wp-content/ and /wp-admin/ folders.</p>
                <p>Once you locate the .htaccess file, right-click and open ‘View/Edit’ option. This will open the file with in a text editor.</p>
                <p>Next, you need to add this line at the bottom of your .htaccess file:</p>
                <code>
                        php_value max_execution_time 300
                </code>
                <p>Another method to fix the maximum execution time exceeded error in WordPress is by modifying your php.ini file.</p>
                <p>The php.ini file is a configuration file that defines settings for PHP on your server. On many WordPress hosting platforms, you may not see it inside your WordPress folder.</p>
                <p>In that case, you can create a new php.ini file inside your WordPress root folder. After that, edit the php.ini file and add the following line.</p>
                <p>max_execution_time = 60</p>
            </div>
