        <h1>Ignoring ESLint</h1>
<p>When ESLint is detected in your project, Next.js fails your production build (next build) when errors are present.</p>
<p>If you'd like Next.js to produce production code even when your application has ESLint errors, you can disable the built-in linting step completely. This is not recommended unless you already have ESLint configured to run in a separate part of your workflow (for example, in CI or a pre-commit hook).</p>
<p>Open next.config.js and enable the ignoreDuringBuilds option in the eslint config:</p>
<pre><code>
    module.exports = {
        eslint: {
          // Warning: This allows production builds to successfully complete even if
          // your project has ESLint errors.
          ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
        },
      }
</code></pre>
